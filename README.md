### Hi there ✤

I'm a <code>developer</code>, <code>designer</code>, and <code>illustrator</code> interested in making mundane things beautiful. 

Currently, I'm building various creation-centered tools, whether they help people collect and organize inspiration, help generate portions of the final product, or provide new mediums for people to create and play with.

Some great examples of these from other talented folks include <a href="https://mymind.com" target="blank">my mind</a> and <a href="https://github.com/afiaka87/clip-guided-diffusion" target="blank">clip guided diffusion</a>.
