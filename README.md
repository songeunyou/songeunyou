### Hi there ✤

I'm a <code>developer</code>, <code>designer</code>, and <code>illustrator</code> interested in making mundane things beautiful. 

I'm currently interested in digital privacy and security, how people develop curiosity, and designs that deal with high information density (documentation, dashboards... Stripe 👀).
