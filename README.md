### Hi there âœ¤

I'm a <code>developer</code>, <code>designer</code>, and <code>illustrator</code> interested in making mundane things beautiful. 

From Aug 2023-Apr 2025 I exclusively focused on getting better at concept art and illustration.

Currently I'm at [Exa](https://exa.ai/) in San Francisco as a design engineer.
