### Hi there ✤

I'm a <code>designer</code> and <code>illustrator</code> interested in making mundane things beautiful. 

From Aug '23-Apr '25 I focused on getting better at concept art and illustration. You can see some of my work on twitter [@songyou](https://x.com/songyou)

Currently I'm at [Exa](https://exa.ai/) in San Francisco as a design engineer.
